    <p>This is a minimalistic web-app that can be used to provide tweets (saved in a MongoDB) with codes based on your own coding-scheme, in order to analyse the tweets later throught QDA, machine learning, etc. The tool was developed for a ML-project in social sciences, where I wanted to train the readme2-Algorithm in R to automatically code huge amounts of tweets in order to investigate how certain attitudes towards a topic/hashtag change over time within the Twitter community.</p>
