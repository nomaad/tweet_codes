# tweet_codes

### What is this?

This is a minimalistic web-app that can be used to provide tweets (saved in a MongoDB) with codes based on your own coding-scheme, in order to analyse the tweets later throught QDA, machine learning, etc. The tool was developed for a ML-project in social sciences, where i wanted to train the [readme2-Algorithm](https://github.com/iqss-research/readme-software) in R to automatically code huge amounts of tweets in order to investigate how certain attitudes towards a topic/hashtag change over time within the Twitter community.

### How is it built?

It is built as a full stack MEVN-app based on [MEVN-CLI](https://github.com/madlabsinc/mevn-cli) thought for local use with a local MongoDB installation.

The JSON-model used in the app to map the tweets is based on the collections generated by [TweetScraper](https://github.com/jonbakerfish/TweetScraper), which I use to scrape tweets and save them directly into a MongoDB collection.
